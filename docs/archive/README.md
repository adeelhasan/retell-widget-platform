# Archived Documentation

This folder contains historical documentation from the project's development phase.

## Contents

### `retell_widget_requirements.md`
**Original project specification and requirements document**

- Created during initial planning phase
- Contains tech stack decisions, database schema design, and API specifications
- Much of this information has been implemented and is now documented in:
  - `/README.md` - User-facing documentation
  - `/database-setup.sql` - Current database schema
  - `/CLAUDE.md` - Developer instructions

**Why Archived**: This was a planning document. The project has been fully implemented and the current documentation (README.md, AUTHENTICATION.md) provides up-to-date information for users and developers.

**Historical Value**: Preserved for reference to understand original design decisions and project evolution.
